# Core Concepts: Modal Deployments & Devstral 24B

## Large Language Model (LLM) Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to a specialized domain or task by continuing its training on a curated dataset. This enables the model to acquire domain-specific knowledge, improve performance on targeted tasks, and support advanced workflows such as code generation, reasoning, and tool-calling.

### Why Fine-Tune?

- **Domain Adaptation:** Enhance model performance for software engineering, scientific research, or enterprise use cases.
- **Instruction Following:** Improve the model's ability to follow complex, multi-step instructions.
- **Tool Use:** Enable the model to interact with APIs, databases, or external systems via tool-calling.

## LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that injects trainable low-rank matrices into each layer of a transformer model. This allows for rapid adaptation with minimal memory and compute overhead, making it feasible to fine-tune very large models (e.g., Devstral 24B) on modest hardware.

- **Advantages:**
  - Reduces GPU memory requirements
  - Enables fast experimentation and deployment
  - Preserves base model weights for reproducibility

## Modal Labs: Cloud-Native AI Infrastructure

Modal Labs provides a scalable, serverless platform for deploying and managing machine learning workloads. Key features include:

- **GPU Acceleration:** On-demand access to high-performance GPUs for training and inference
- **Container Orchestration:** Automated provisioning, scaling, and lifecycle management
- **API Exposure:** Seamless deployment of FastAPI or custom endpoints for model serving

## Ollama: Model Management & Inference

Ollama is a lightweight, extensible system for managing, running, and customizing LLMs. In this project, Ollama is used to:

- Pull and cache base models (e.g., Devstral 24B)
- Build custom models from Modelfiles
- Serve models via a local or remote API
- Integrate with Modal Labs for cloud deployment

## Agentic Coding Workflows

Agentic workflows refer to the use of LLMs as autonomous or semi-autonomous agents capable of:

- **Code Generation:** Writing, refactoring, and explaining code
- **Tool-Calling:** Invoking external APIs, scripts, or services
- **Reasoning:** Solving complex, multi-step problems with chain-of-thought or scratchpad methods

## Reproducibility & Experimentation

- **YAML Configuration:** All model, training, and deployment parameters are version-controlled and human-readable
- **Dataset Versioning:** Use Hugging Face Datasets or local files with explicit versioning for reproducible experiments
- **Experiment Tracking:** Integrate with Weights & Biases (W&B) for logging, visualization, and comparison

## Security & Best Practices

- **Dependency Management:** Use `pyproject.toml` and pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and security
- **Access Control:** Configure API endpoints and Modal Labs deployments with appropriate authentication and rate limiting
- **Monitoring:** Enable logging and monitoring for all production deployments
